Specification of the Design
###################################

The purpose of this design was to develop a 30 MHz fractional-N PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) that meets the specified performance criteria while minimizing power consumption and area. The design should be suitable for integration into a larger system-on-chip (SoC) and capable of supporting various output clock frequencies.
